# Assignment 2 - MySQL

Group: 36 \
Students: Eivind Dalholt, Vegard Henriksen and Synne Ã˜degaard

## Introduction
Briefly explain the task and the problems you have solved. How did you work as a group? If you used Git, a link to the repository would be nice.

The exercise was based on the Geodata GPS Trajectory dataset. First, the dataset had to be cleaned and inserted into a MySQL database, created by the group. Then, SQL queries and Python code were used to manipulate the data in order to answer questions. The answers can be found under Results.

## Results
Add your results from the tasks, both as text and screenshots. Short sentences are sufficient.

## Discussion
Discuss your solutions. Did you do anything differently than how it was explained in the assignment sheet, in that case why and how did that work? Were there any pain points or problems? What did you learn from this assignment?

## Feedback
Optional - give us feedback on the task if you have any. The assignment is new this semester and we would love to improve if there were any problems.
